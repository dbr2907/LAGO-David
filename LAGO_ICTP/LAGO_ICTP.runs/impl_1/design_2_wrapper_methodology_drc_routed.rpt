There is a large setup violation of -5.584 ns between design_2_i/comblock_0/U0/comblock_i/fifo_ftp_g.fifo1_i/g_async.i_sync_rd2wr/i_sync/data_r_reg[1][8]/C (clocked by design_2_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/BUFG_O[0]) and design_2_i/comblock_0/U0/comblock_i/fifo_ftp_g.fifo1_i/i_memory/ram_reg_0/DIADI[0] (clocked by design_2_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/BUFG_O[0]). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

Clock defined on multiple objects  
The clock design_2_i/ADC_Controller/util_ds_buf_2/U0/IBUF_OUT[15] is defined on multiple objects. Although this is logically functional for timing analysis, it cannot exist in hardware. It is recommended to define a primary clock on a single object.
